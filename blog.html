        <h3 class="title">Effect of Measurement uints on Html element</h3>
        <article>
            <p>
                The length CSS data type represents a distance value. Lengths can be used in many CSS properties, such as width, height, margin, padding, border-width, font-size and so on.
                There are mainly two types of Measurement uints. those are relative and absolute length unit.lets see each one by one, before gonna to 
                the effect on responsive ness of the html elemnt on diffrent mediums(devices). <br>
                <strong>Relative  unit Measurement</strong>: In this type of units the Measurement represent interms of the other distance i.e Font size of the parent container, length of view port of the actual devices.
                again, if we want represent a length interms of fontsize of the parent, we can use like em , rem , ex .... and if we want in viewport ,we can use vh , vw , vmin... instead. <br>
                <strong>absolute unit Measurement</strong> : In this type of units the actual Measurement will represents with out considering the actual devices we use. i.e if we represent 10cm or 200px , when we it will represet as we write with out responsiveness. <br>
                Now, let's back on the effect of those on responsive. the responsiveness of the html element is on the hand of the two Measurement units. because as i said earlier when we represent the length of the html element in relative unit it will responsive, since it 
                will use the parents  properties regaring the viewport of the device. when we use absolute unit we can't get responsive website due to screen size of the devices.
                In conculsion, the use of relative and absolute Measurement units matter on the responsiveness of the website.

            <h3 class="title">Default  Browser Font-size and it's Interpretaion</h3>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The font size or text size is how large the characters displayed on a screen(which is browsers)or printed on a page are.
                    if we are gonna to change the font-size of the Default fontsize of the html we can use fontsize of the css propertie.
                    sicne Font-size is css propertie. but till we specified the fontsize of the html root element the defualt value is 16px. <br>
 
                    lets see it's Interpretaion, if we assign the fontsize, width , height.....of html element like 200px, the browser will Interprete it as follow.
                    16px=100% , so what is 200px in termes of percent then again recaluclated it by 16px. <br>
                     again let's back our question 200px mean 200*100%/16.

                <h3 class="title">Specific Changes on CSS3</h3>
                <article>
                 <p>
                    CSS3 is the latest version of CSS that has been published since 2005. CSS3 has a bunch of new  features like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new types of layouts like multi-columns, Flex box or grid layouts. 
                    It contains everything from the previous version (CSS). <br> lets see some features in detail. <br>
                    <strong>rounded corners</strong>Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to apply the border-radius CSS3 property to HTML elements. <br>
                    <strong>selectors</strong>in addition to well known selectors, in css3 there are some selectors, those are: <br>
                    <em>Attribute selector</em> These selectors allow to apply one determined formatting to certain elements based on the value of one attribute. it's syntax is Element[attribute="value"] <br>
                    <em>Postion selectors</em>These selectors work based on the position of the element in the document or in the control that contains it (parent element).
                    it's syntax is :element
                    <strong>gradients</strong> in this version we can achive the gradient of the background as an image by this syntax background:Lineargradient(postion,values in order) <br>
                    <strong>Animations and transitions</strong> the most intersting part of this version is those properties. by using those properties we can do greate animation just like as we achived by javascript or some other method.
                    <em>Animation</em> it have many properties for acheving what we want like, animation duration , animation direction , animation name (to connect specific html element).
                    <br>
                    <em>Transformation</em> THis hava many values like rotate , translate, scale in both 2d and 3d
